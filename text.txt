git log — See all commit history. Can also be used for a file with git log -p my_file. Enter q to exit.

git blame my_file— See who changed what and when in my_file.

git reflog — Show a log of changes to the local repository’s HEAD. Good for finding lost work.

git reset, git checkout, and git revert are used to undo the effects of changes to your repository.

git reset and git checkout can be used on both commits and individual files.

git revert is used only at the commit level.

If you are working collaboratively and need to neutralize a commit in the remote branch, git revert is your tool.

git reset --hard HEAD— Discard staged and unstaged changes since the most recent commit.

git clean -n —Delete untracked files in the local working directory.

git commit --amend — Add your staged changes to the most recent commit.
If nothing is staged, this command just allows you to edit the most recent commit message.

git push my_remote --tags —Send all local tags to the remote repo. Good for versioning changes.
